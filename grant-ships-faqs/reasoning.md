<summary>Why not just have a grants council?</summary>

We wanted to emphasize a pluralistic approach and avoid centralization of power. Grant Ships unbundles the functions of a traditional, centralized grants-giving committee and distributes power and responsibility among 3 groups: Grant Ships, Referees, and the voting community.

Together, these 3 groups have all the power and responsibility of a grants council but ensure a broader representation of perspectives and mitigate the risk of undue influence. However, because many of the relevant permissions and processes are explicitly defined, we offload the governance overhead that a grant-giving organization would normally be responsible for designing.

Grant Ships are free to focus on transparently allocating funds. Referees make sure the rules are being followed. Members of Arbitrum DAO need only focus on voting on their favorite Grant Ships and checking power where needed.

In essence, we aim to get the best of both worlds. We get the capture-resistance of a decentralized organization, as well as the efficiency and clarity of a traditional structure.

Here is a diagram showing how this system could be built:\

While we're mostly agnostic about the tech that each Grant Ship uses, we believe that **Hats Protocol** is an ideal tool for creating the structural 'skeleton' for this system.

<summary>This all seems complicated, why not do something simpler?</summary>

The more distributed and decentralized a system is, the more its rules must be explicitly defined. In centralized grant-giving solutions, the complexity is hidden in the internal political dynamics and decision-making processes of the responsible team.

By providing this structure for a pluralistic approach, we relieve teams of managing a major portion of the complexity by systematizing it, and then allowing them to focus on the equally complex problem domain which is "How to Give Grants Effectively."
