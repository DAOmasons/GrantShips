<summary>How does the Ship Ranking Vote work?</summary>

The Ship Ranking Vote is a weighted token vote that occurs at the end of each season, and is an opportunity for the Arbitrum community to rate and rank the performance of the active Grant Ships.

The Portfolio Reports from each Grant Ship are first made available for review. Then, each ARB holder has the opportunity to 'weight' the performance of each Grant Ship. They receive votes equal to their token count and can assign them across the Grant Ships as they see fit. The vote total received by each ship is divided by the total number of votes received by all ships. This number determines the proportion of the total funding pool they receive in the upcoming season.

Additionally, any new crew that have applied can receive votes at this time. If an active Grant Ship crew fails to receive a minimum threshold of support, they are evacuated from their ship and replaced with the highest-rated new crew.
