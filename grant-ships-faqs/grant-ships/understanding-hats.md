<summary>What is a Hats Tree?</summary>

A Hats tree is a network of non-transferable ERC-1155 compatible tokens. They allow a DAO to build a 'tree-shaped' role and permission structure where each token can manage the tokens below it, but not above. Placing the 'Top Hat' on Arbitrum DAO ensures that the ultimate decision-making power is granted to the most decentralized player in this game.

By offloading operational authority and responsibility, Arbitrum DAO needn't be burdened with every decision -- only revoking authority when needed.

Hats also have the additional benefit of providing an easy map of all the key players involved. Referees, Grant Ships, and Grant Recipients could all be made visible in one live chart that sources purely from on-chain data.
