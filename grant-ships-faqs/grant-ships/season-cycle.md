<summary>What is a Grant Season?</summary>

A Grant Season or Season for short, is a period of 3 months and is broken into 2 phases: the Allocation Phase and the Review Phase.

<summary>What happens during the Allocation Phase?</summary>

This is the period where Grant Recipients are funded and begin producing results. This is also where most of the interaction between Grant Ships, Grant Recipients and the community occurs.

<summary>What happens during the Review Phase?</summary>

This is the phase where Grant Ships submit their Portfolio Report for review by the community and Referees. A community vote is initiated and the results determine funding levels for the upcoming season. If a crew fails to receive a minimum threshold of support from the community, new crews are onboarded to that ship during this period.
