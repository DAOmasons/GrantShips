<summary>How does the Common Funding Pool receive funds?</summary>

Presumably these funds are being supplied by Arbitrum DAO itself, so whatever process they use to disburse funds would need to be used to fill the pool. The pool could also be opened to receive funds from other sources looking to support Arbitrum Grants. Ideally, this Common Funding Pool would be refreshed each Season automatically.

<summary>What if this rulebook has a flaw or needs to be updated?</summary>

During the course of a season, the Referee Team is responsible for adjudicating the rules. If they see an inconsistency or flaw, they have the purview to make adjustments on the fly to maintain the integrity of the game. These issues should be documented and submitted for review at the end of each season.

Variables such as the number of Grant Ships, minimum vote thresholds, size of the Referee Team, and funding levels can be set depending on the needs and wants of the community when the game begins.
