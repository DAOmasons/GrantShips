<summary>What is a Grant Ship?</summary>

A Grant Ship is a subDAO. It receives funds each season based on its past performance, with the expectation that it will distribute those funds as ecosystem grants.

<details>

<summary>How are Grant Ships Selected?</summary>

When the game first begins, teams can apply to become Grant Ships. A weighted token vote is held, and the top 6 teams are assigned to become Grant Ships.

</details>

<details>

<summary>What powers do Grant Ships have?</summary>

Grant Ships have 2 main powers: Distribution & Disclosure. A Grant Ship receives funding and has permission to distribute the funds. It also can make official on-chain disclosures.

</details>

<details>

<summary>What are the expectations of a Grant Ship?</summary>

Grant Ships can operate however they like but are expected to submit a complete Portfolio Report at the end of a funding season, disclose who they are funding (as the funding occurs), and disclose major internal decisions and announcements on-chain.

</details>

<details>

<summary>What happens if a Grant Ship doesn't meet those expectations?</summary>

The Referee Team assigns the Grant Ship a "yellow flag" (rules violation) or "red flag" (bad faith) that adds context for the end-of-season Ship Ranking Vote.

</details>

<details>

<summary>How does a Grant Ship receive funding?</summary>

In the first season, all Grant Ships receive an equal portion of funding from a Common Funding Pool. In the following seasons, the Grant Ship's portion of the Funding Pool is proportional to their performance in the previous season, relative to other active Grant Ships.

</details>

<details>

<summary>How is Grant Ship's performance measured?</summary>

At the end of each season, each Grant Ship is required to submit a Portfolio Report. Portfolio Reports are ranked during the Ship Ranking Vote at the end of each season.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Why isn't there a set governance structure for each Grant Ship?</summary>

We believe that optimal models for grant distribution have yet to be discovered. Only through experimentation and real-world tests can we begin to narrow in on what might be the best model for a decentralized grants committee.
