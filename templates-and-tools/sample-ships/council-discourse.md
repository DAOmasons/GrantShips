# ðŸ¤¹ Council - Discourse

### Tools needed for this Ship:

* Deployment of Council contracts

{% hint style="info" %}
Council is not for web3 beginers and requires someone knowledagle to enough to fork the Council repo, edit scripts and deploy. Also, there are a lot of contracts involved with deploying a Council DAO, as such it is requires an intensive amount of calls to your node provider and the deployment itself may not work on free levels of the node providers.
{% endhint %}

* Discourse
* Allo
