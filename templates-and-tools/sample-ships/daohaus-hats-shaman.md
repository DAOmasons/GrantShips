# üè∞ DAOhaus - Hats Shaman

### Tools needed for this Ship:

* DAOhaus DAOs
* Hats Onboarding Shaman
* TCR App
* Discord

### How This Ship Floats

#### Easy DAO creation

DAOhaus provides a suite of tool to build custom DAO dApps. What is also really nice about the DAOhaus platform is they make it easy to summon a new DAO from within their summoners app. However don't let the ease of summoning fool you, DAOhaus is a powerful tool which uses the Moloch DAO v3 contracts providing an array of governance options.

#### Small DAOs DAOhaus Shines

The DAOhaus protocol certainly has the chops to perform alongside any DAO governance framework but it really shines when it comes to managing smaller teams. As Grant Ships is designed around small teams, DAOhaus is perfectly suited for this game.

#### DAOhaus Onboarding Hats Onboarding Shaman

Hats Protocol has developed a "Shaman" contract which on-boards and off-boards members of a Moloch DAO based on if they are wearing a Hat or not. This is fits perfectly with our game as it will allow the game to remove or sideline players as needed.

#### Insert TCR app?

TCR and or Quadratic App, maybe Allo?
