### Grant Ships and JokeDAO: A New Paradigm for Community-Driven Funding

#### How Could a Grant Ship Work with JokeDAO?

**Seamless Integration**

JokeDAO's bottom-up, on-chain governance is a perfect match for the Grant Ship model. Community members can propose grant initiatives directly within the JokeDAO platform, and these proposals can be voted on using `$JOKE` tokens.

**Community-Driven Allocation**

Instead of a centralized team deciding on grant allocations, the community gets to vote on which proposals should be funded. This aligns well with JokeDAO's ethos of actual decentralized governance.

**Multi-Chain Support**

Just like JokeDAO supports multiple EVM-compatible chains, Grant Ships can also be deployed on various chains, making it easier for a broader community to participate.

#### Features of JokeDAO's Grant Ship

**Transparent Voting**

All votes for grant proposals are transparent and can be verified on-chain. This ensures a fair and transparent allocation process.

**Dynamic Fund Management**

The Grant Ship allows for dynamic allocation of funds based on community votes. This means the community can decide to increase or decrease funding for a particular grant in real-time.

**Rewards and Incentives**

Community members who participate in the grant allocation process can earn rewards in `$JOKE` tokens, further incentivizing active participation.

#### How to Get Started with JokeDAO's Grant Ship

1. **Proposal Submission**: Any community member can submit a grant proposal on JokeDAO's platform.
2. **Community Voting**: Once the proposal is live, members can vote using their `$JOKE` tokens.
3. **Fund Allocation**: After the voting period, funds are automatically allocated to the winning proposals.
4. **Progress Tracking**: The community can track the progress of funded projects, ensuring accountability and transparency.

#### Conclusion

The integration of Grant Ships with JokeDAO represents a significant advancement in how community-driven projects can be funded. It not only democratizes the grant allocation process but also ensures that funds are allocated to projects that have the most community support.
