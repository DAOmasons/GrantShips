### Allo Protocol and Its Relevance to Grant Ships

[https://allo.gitcoin.co/](https://allo.gitcoin.co/)

Allo Protocol is a set of smart contracts developed by Gitcoin to democratize the allocation and distribution of capital. Initially designed to power the Gitcoin Grants Stack, the protocol has broader applications, including in Grant Ships.

#### Why Allo Protocol?

The crypto ecosystem has provided various tools for capital formation like token drops, NFTs, and staking. However, the allocation of this capital back into the community has been inefficient. Allo Protocol aims to solve this by offering a toolkit for experimenting with capital allocation mechanisms such as Quadratic Funding, eligibility criteria, and distribution methods.

#### Core Components of Allo Protocol

**Pool Manager**

* **Purpose**: Acts as the core contract for managing pools of funds.

**Allocation Strategies**

* **Purpose**: Custom contracts that determine how a pool's funds are distributed.

**Project Registry**

* **Purpose**: An on-chain registry for projects, used for reputation and eligibility.

#### How Allo Protocol Works

**Pool**

* **Concept**: Funds are distributed in pools, each owned by a profile in the registry.
* **Example**: A DAO could create a new pool each quarter for community projects.

**Allocation Strategy**

* **Determines**:
  * Who is eligible to receive funding?
  * Who can vote on fund allocation?
  * How are payouts determined?
  * How are funds distributed (lump-sum, milestone-based, etc.)?

**Project Registry**

* **Goal**: To help projects build reputation and find new funding sources.
* **Features**:
  * Unique address for each project.
  * Can be used for attestations or holding Soul-bound Tokens.

#### Relevance to Grant Ships

1. **Grants Tooling**: Allo can be used to manage the grants within a Grant Ship.
2. **Bounties and RFPs**: The protocol can handle bounties and requests for proposals.
3. **Circular Economic Systems**: Allo can facilitate the creation of self-sustaining economic systems within a Grant Ship.
4. **Mechanism Design**: Allows for experimentation with different capital allocation mechanisms.
5. **Wrapped Voting**: Enables more complex voting mechanisms for fund allocation.

#### Conclusion

Allo Protocol offers a robust framework for the democratic allocation of capital, making it highly relevant for Grant Ships that aim to distribute funds in a community-driven manner. Its modular architecture allows for a high degree of customization, enabling Grant Ships to experiment with various capital allocation and distribution strategies.
