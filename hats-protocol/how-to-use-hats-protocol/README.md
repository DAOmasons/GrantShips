# â›‘ How to use Hats Protocol

{% hint style="info" %}
Hats are organized in a tree structure, called a "Hats tree". Each tree can hold all the hats for a given organization, or you could create a new tree for each team or project (you can always link trees together later)\
In either case, the first step to creating a new Hats tree is to create the "Top Hat": the root of a Hats tree which serves as a super-admin for all of the other hats that will be added to the tree. - [Hats Docs ](https://docs.hatsprotocol.xyz/using-hats/creating-my-first-hat#1.-creating-a-new-tree)
{% endhint %}

Hats can be used in a few different ways in the Grant Ships game. The part of the game setup involves creating a Hat Tree, which will grant the formation of Ships. Any Ship that receives funding must hold an active Hat.&#x20;

If the Ship is under performing, abandoned or not following the rules of the game, the ships Hat may be revoked and funding stream stopped for that ship. The ship may continue to exist, without funding from the DAO and may have Hat reinstated if the DAO decides to do so.

This is why it is important to build a Hat tree at the very start of the game, to ensure accountability at the very beginning.&#x20;

Also note, a Hat being revoked may not always represent disciplinary action. Eligibility modules can be programmed to recognize the end of a project, due to time constraints and automatically revoke Hats on a particular schedule.

Within Ships themselves, Hat trees can be used to assign responsibilities within the ship. This will be up to the ship itself as they will have a lot of latitude in choosing their own governance designs.

Other roles within the Game, such as referees will also have Hats issued.

The Top Hat itself, for the "main" tree will be held by the DAO and will be used to approve the initial tree structure. The DAO must establish terms for eligibility modules and approving them as they are created.
