# ðŸ§¢ Hats App and Repo

The Hats Protocol repo contains a number of pre built eligibility modules that a ship can Deploy\
[https://github.com/Hats-Protocol/](https://github.com/Hats-Protocol/)

Managing your Hats is most easily performed on the Hats App\
[https://app.hatsprotocol.xyz/](https://app.hatsprotocol.xyz/)

However, if a Ship prefers, they can build a custom front end for their ship and utilize the Hats Protocol SDK: [https://docs.hatsprotocol.xyz/for-developers/v1-core-sdk](https://docs.hatsprotocol.xyz/for-developers/v1-core-sdk)
