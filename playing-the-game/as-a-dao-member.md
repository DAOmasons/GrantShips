# ðŸ‘¹ As A DAO Member

**Draft**

### &#x20;Playing as a DAO Member 

As a DAO Member in the Grant Ships ecosystem, you hold a unique position of power and responsibility, often symbolized by holding the \*\*Top Hat\*\*. This grants you the authority to influence the game's dynamics and ensure its integrity.\
\
One of your primary roles is to \*\*Vote to Distribute Hats to Ships\*\*. By doing so, you help define the hierarchical structure and permissions within each Grant Ship, effectively shaping their operational capabilities.\
\
If the game's rules call for it, you may also be required to \*\*Vote for Priorities\*\*. This could range from deciding which types of projects should be prioritized for grants to setting overarching goals for the Grant Ships.\
\
Your voice matters beyond just voting; you are encouraged to \*\*Comment on Proposals and Suggest Improvements\*\*. Providing constructive criticism, praise, and even alternative strategies enriches the decision-making process and contributes to the game's evolution.\
\
Lastly, you have the power to \*\*Vote on Allocations to Ships\*\* at the end of each funding season. Your vote directly impacts which Grant Ships will have more or less capital to work with in the next round, thereby influencing the game's future direction.\
