*   ### Playing as a Grantee

    As a Grantee in the Grant Ships game, your role is pivotal for the ecosystem's growth and innovation. First and foremost, **Being Truthful** is non-negotiable. Honesty in your application and subsequent reporting is the cornerstone of trust between you, the Grant Ship, and the broader community.

If the game's rules or the Grant Ship requires it, you must **Perform KYC (Know Your Customer)** procedures. This adds an extra layer of accountability and is often a prerequisite for funding.

Before receiving any funds, you must **Agree to Terms and Service** as well as **Milestone Reporting**. These agreements outline what is expected of you and what you can expect from the Grant Ship. They often include timelines, deliverables, and reporting requirements that you are obliged to meet.

It's crucial that you **Use Funds for the Intended Purpose**. Misuse of funds not only jeopardizes your project but also undermines the integrity of the entire Grant Ships ecosystem.

You are also expected to **Follow Any Other Rules or Stipulations** set forth by the Grant Ship or the game's guidelines. This could include anything from regular check-ins to specific types of disclosure.

Lastly, it's important to understand and agree that **Funding is Dependent on Milestones and Following the Rules**. Failure to meet your milestones or abide by the rules could result in the discontinuation of your funding and possible disqualification from future grant opportunities.
