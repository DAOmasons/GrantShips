### Playing as a Member of a Grant Ship

As a member of a Grant Ship, your role is multifaceted and crucial for the success of your team. Your primary responsibility is to **Distribute Funds to Quality Applicants**. This involves a rigorous vetting process to ensure that only the most promising and aligned projects receive funding.

**Following the Rules** set forth by the game and your Grant Ship is non-negotiable. Adherence to these guidelines ensures a fair and transparent game for all participants.

**Implementing Strategies** is another key aspect. Whether it's a strategy for fund allocation, applicant screening, or community engagement, effective strategy implementation can set your Grant Ship apart from the rest.

**Staying Engaged** throughout the funding season is vital. Active participation in discussions, decision-making, and reporting is expected from each member.

**Funding Grants that Align** with the goals and values of the Arbitrum ecosystem and your Grant Ship is essential. This alignment ensures that the funds are utilized in a manner that resonates with the community and achieves the desired impact.

**Effective Strategy Use** is not just about creation but also about enactment. Strategies should be revisited and tweaked as needed to adapt to changing conditions and feedback.

Lastly, the **Ship Lead Issues Hats to Members**, a unique feature enabled by the Hats Protocol. These 'hats' serve as non-transferable tokens that define your role and permissions within the Grant Ship, adding another layer of structure and accountability to the game.
