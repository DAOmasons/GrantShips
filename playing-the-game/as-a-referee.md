\*\*draft\*

*   ### Playing as a Referee

    As a Referee in the Grant Ships game, you serve as the guardian of integrity and fairness. Your primary role is to **Ensure Ships are Following Rules**. This involves closely monitoring the activities of each Grant Ship to ensure they are adhering to the game's guidelines and their own set protocols.

    **Issuing Warning Cards to Ships Not Following Rules** is one of your key responsibilities. These warning cards serve as formal notices and can range from yellow cards for minor infractions to red cards for severe violations or bad faith actions.

    A **New Idea** you might consider is **Issuing Warning Cards to Grantees Not Following Rules**. Just like Grant Ships, grantees must also adhere to certain guidelines. Failure to do so should result in a warning card, ensuring accountability at all levels of the game.

    Lastly, as a Referee, you are also bound by rules, specifically those **Set in the Hat Enabling Your Status**. These 'hats,' enabled by the Hats Protocol, define your role, responsibilities, and permissions within the game. It is crucial to follow any additional rules or guidelines set forth in your 'hat' to maintain the integrity of your position and the game at large.
