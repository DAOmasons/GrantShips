## Executive Summary

### Landscape

We believe that the current landscape in Web3 grant giving needs a new set of models to be tested and deployed and opportunity be given to discover skilled people at developing and deploying effective strategies for grant giving.

While we do look at many current organizations with reverence, our goal is not to stand against or in competition with any grant giving organization. We would hope grant ships could in fact be used in parallel. For example, it would be quite easy to integrate a chili pod fro Metacartel into Grant Ships, taking advantage of the skills develop over years of running a particular type of grants awarded by Metacartel. 

### Grant Game Theory Dynamics

In Grant Ships, we harness the power of competition to enhance performance. Our ecosystem primarily operates on a positive-sum approach, ensuring mutual benefits. However, we introduce a strategic competitive element: Ships delivering high-impact grants secure increased funding, while those with lower impact face reduced allocations. This nuanced balance between cooperation and competition motivates Ships to strive for excellence, driving the overall success of the network.

#### Nash Equilibrium in Grant Ships

In Grant Ships, our principal objective is to amplify impact by steering incentives towards high-impact grant allocations, a strategy deeply rooted in Nash Equilibrium principles from game theory. This equilibrium state ensures that no Ship or participant gains by solely changing their strategy unless others do the same. By focusing on high-quality, impactful grants, we create a positive feedback loop that increases the likelihood of securing more substantial funding. This approach moves away from a numbers-driven strategy of maximizing grant quantity, pivoting towards a quality-centric approach. Embracing the Nash Equilibrium, we foster an environment where each Ship and participant is incentivized to contribute effectively to the collective growth. This collaborative mindset aligns with our mission to drive the Ethereum network's expansion and scaling within the Arbitrum ecosystem, ensuring a thriving, balanced environment for all.

### Governance

Grant Ships is designed as a progressive decentralized game. While the beta and alpha rounds will maintain some centralization as the game mechanics are being tested, future rounds will have free and fair elections for all positions within the game, including administrators and ship operators. All governance decisions will be handed over to Arbitrum DAO.

### Rules

We have developed an initial set of rules for how the game is organized and played. This is subject to change as the game is tested and becomes more decentralized. This paper will give a brief overview of the rules and what you will find in the current version of the rule book.

### Compliance

Grant Ships has developed a compliance policy in which all participants are expected to sign off on and follow. Failure to be in compliance could result in the immediate revocation of a players permission to play the game. This will be further explain in our technical overview.

## What is a Grant Ship?

A Grant Ship is a Sub DAO of Arbitrum DAO. Each Ship is allocated funding during a funding round, to be distributed to successful Grant applicants.

Each active Ship is able to design and implement their grant system, with a goal of providing Grants to people or projects that support the known priorities of Arbitrum DAO.

Ship operators must follow the rules of the game, such as alignment with our compliance policy and or providing a high level of ethical standards. Other than that, operators are free to run their ships as they please. They may set up their own communications channels and create their own rules that they will follow.

## Existing Grants Frameworks

This is a very brief on a few of the many Grant givers in the space. While there are many more and I am certainly not hitting all of the methos they use to allocate funding, this group gives a fair representation as to what *most* programs operate.
### Gitcoin

- Utilizes a variety of tools similar to Grant Ships.
- Implements seasonal initiatives.
- Employs crowdfunding/quadratic funding models with matching pools.
- [Gitcoin Grants Program](https://www.gitcoin.co/program)

### Metacartel / Moloch Model

- Two operational models:
  -   Forum proposal basis/presentation/DAO Proposal
  - noted for slower processing.
  - Chili pods, akin to Grant Ships but lacking accountability, primarily active in in-person events.

### Giveth

- Rewards contributors through a staking mechanism, part of which supports funding pools.
- Incorporates DeFi strategies.

### Octant

- Involves staking Golem tokens to allocate rewards to various projects or donation pools.
- Runs seasonal rounds every three months.
- Golem stakes substantial ETH for additional grant funding.

### Optimism PGR Rounds

- Retroactively funds impactful projects on Optimism.
- Critique: The model encourages working without guaranteed compensation.

### Gnosis

- Described as being managed with rigid control and complex application processes.
- Funding is categorized into specific initiatives, which can be limiting for cross-disciplinary projects.

### Nouns

- Relies on forum postings, lacks focused direction.

## Comparative Analysis: Similarities and Differences

Grant Ships stands out with its pluralistic nature, allowing for diverse approaches in grant allocation. Pluralism here means the coexistence of multiple states, groups, principles, or authorities, as well as the recognition of more than one ultimate principle. This philosophical foundation enables Grant Ships to experiment with various grant allocation methodologies, like retroactive funding for completed projects or support for ongoing initiatives.

This flexibility and the ability to adapt to different philosophies and tools is what makes Grant Ships unique and effective. It captures a range of approaches to grant awards, acknowledging that the best methods are often situation-dependent. The platform's goal is to foster an environment conducive to innovation and experimentation in grant allocation.

## Game Theory in Grant Ships

### Overview of Game Theory Application

Game theory, a study of strategic decision-making, plays a critical role in shaping the dynamics of Grant Ships. By leveraging game theory principles, Grant Ships aims to create a competitive yet collaborative environment, driving participants towards optimal performance and contribution. This section explores the key game theories utilized in Grant Ships and how they influence behavior and outcomes within the ecosystem.

### Nash Equilibrium in the Context of Grant Ships

#### Strategic Decision-Making:
- In Grant Ships, each Ship (or player) makes strategic decisions regarding the allocation of grants, the selection of projects, and the adoption of various approaches to maximize their impact within the Arbitrum ecosystem.
- These decisions are based not only on their own goals and objectives but also on an understanding of the strategies and actions of other Ships.

#### Mutual Interdependence:
- The strategic interdependence among Ships is a crucial aspect. Each Ship's decision potentially influences the choices of others. For example, if one Ship adopts a particularly effective grant allocation strategy, others might be inclined to adopt similar strategies, leading to a form of strategic alignment.
- However, the goal is not to have a homogenous set of strategies but rather a diverse yet stable ecosystem where each Ship's approach is respected and valued. The goal is to all ships performing effectively with the highest degree of impact for Arbitrum.

#### Achieving Nash Equilibrium:
- Nash Equilibrium in Grant Ships is achieved when all Ships, after considering the strategies of others, find that they cannot improve their position by unilaterally changing their strategy.
- This doesn’t mean that all Ships follow the same strategy. Instead, it indicates that each Ship has found a strategy that works best for them within the context of the overall game environment and the actions of other Ships.

#### Stability and Dynamism:
- The equilibrium brings a certain level of stability to the ecosystem. Ships are less likely to make frequent, drastic changes to their strategies, leading to a more predictable and reliable grant allocation process.
- However, this stability does not imply stagnation. Ships can still innovate and adapt within their strategic framework, contributing to the dynamism and evolution of the Grant Ships ecosystem.

#### Encouraging Collaboration and Competition:
- By striving for Nash Equilibrium, Grant Ships encourages a balance between collaboration and competition. Ships are motivated to compete by improving their strategies but also to collaborate, as the success of the ecosystem depends on the collective contributions of all participants.

### Why Achieve Nash Equilibrium?

#### For the Arbitrum Ecosystem:

1. **Stability and Predictability:** When Grant Ships reach a Nash Equilibrium, it creates a stable and predictable environment within the Arbitrum ecosystem. This stability attracts more developers and projects, as they can rely on consistent and rational funding patterns.
2. **Optimized Resource Allocation:** Nash Equilibrium leads to more efficient allocation of resources. Ships, understanding each other's strategies, are less likely to waste resources on ineffective or duplicated efforts.
3. **Enhanced Reputation:** A balanced and well-functioning grant system enhances the reputation of the Arbitrum ecosystem, positioning it as a leading platform for innovation and community-driven development.
4. **Impact Incentives:** Players that are playing the game and want to continue to play the game must constantly strive to provide maximum impact, not only could it threaten their own survival in the game but the survival of the game itself.

*This diagram shows what would happen in a hypothetical Grant Ship scenarios. In these scenarios the maximum total impact that can be obtained would be a score of 6. According to Nash's Equillibrium, if both ships were working towards the same goal, that is the score that would be achieved. If one ship was working to that goal and the other doing something else, the total score that can be achieved is 1. If they are both working towards low impact grants, the highest score achievable is 2.*

#### For Grant Recipients:

1. **Fair and Transparent Funding:** A Nash Equilibrium scenario ensures that grant allocation is fair, transparent, and based on the merit of the projects, as Ships would have optimized their strategies to support the most impactful projects.
2. **Diverse Funding Opportunities:** With each Ship adopting a strategy that works best within the equilibrium, grant recipients benefit from a diversity of funding avenues and criteria, catering to a wider range of projects and needs.
3. **Consistent Support:** Recipients can expect consistent support and guidelines from the Ships, which helps in better planning and execution of their projects.

#### For an Individual Grant Ship:

1. **Strategic Efficiency:** Achieving Nash Equilibrium allows a Grant Ship to operate with a strategy that is most efficient and effective given the context of other Ships’ strategies. This reduces wasted efforts and increases the impact of their funding.
2. **Competitive Edge:** While the equilibrium ensures stability, it also encourages Ships to innovate within their strategic framework to maintain or enhance their effectiveness, thus fostering a healthy competitive environment.
3. **Community Alignment:** A Grant Ship operating at equilibrium is well-aligned with the community’s needs and expectations, leading to better relationships with project creators and increased trust within the ecosystem.
4.  **Program Success:** The project simply is not a success if only one ship ends up providing impact. In this scenario, the program itself would be in danger of folding. Likewise if all shiops were only providing low impact grants, while the system would technically be in balance, the program could not be considered a success as maximum impact is not being achieved.


The achievement of Nash Equilibrium within Grant Ships is beneficial across multiple levels. For the Arbitrum ecosystem, it brings stability and efficiency; for grant recipients, it ensures fairness, diversity, and consistency; and for individual Grant Ships, it results in strategic efficiency, competitive advantage, and stronger community alignment. This equilibrium is not about uniformity but about finding the most effective role each player can have in a complex, dynamic system, leading to collective growth and innovation.

In Grant Ships, the Nash Equilibrium chart, inspired by the Stag and Hare game theory, serves as a strategic guide for decision-making. This theory explores the dilemma faced by Grant Ships - whether to pursue a collaborative, high-reward strategy or an individualistic, low-reward one. The chart illustrates various scenarios based on these choices and their impact on the overall effectiveness of grant distribution.

### Analyzing the Quadrant Chart

- **Quadrant 1 (Both High Impact):** Representing the ideal scenario, this quadrant sees both ships striving for high-impact grants. The synergy between the two results in optimal outcomes and the highest level of effectiveness.
  
- **Quadrant 2 (Ship 1 High Impact - Ship 2 Low Impact):** In this less effective scenario, Ship 1 aims for high impact, but Ship 2 opts for low-impact grants. This unbalanced approach leads to suboptimal results, as the potential of collaborative high-impact strategies is not fully realized.

- **Quadrant 3 (Ship 1 Low Impact - Ship 2 High Impact):** Mirroring Quadrant 2, but with reversed roles, this scenario similarly demonstrates reduced effectiveness due to the lack of a unified high-impact approach.

- **Quadrant 4 (Both Low Impact):** Here, both ships focus on low-impact grants, typically easier to fund but less effective. This choice leads to moderate outcomes, reflecting a risk-averse strategy with limited potential for significant impact.

### Impact Dynamics in Grant Ships

- **Impact Correlation with Positioning:** The positioning of points within each quadrant directly correlates with the impact level. The highest impact (score of 3 for each ship) is achieved in Quadrant 1, emphasizing the importance of a cooperative high-impact approach.

- **Impact Disparity in Uncoordinated Strategies:** When one ship commits to high impact and the other does not, as seen in Quadrants 2 and 3, the overall effectiveness is significantly hampered. This underscores the necessity of cooperative strategies for maximizing impact.

- **Moderate Impact in Uniform Low Effort:** A mutual focus on low-impact grants in Quadrant 4 yields moderate effectiveness. This scenario is akin to settling for the hare in the Stag and Hare theory, reflecting a preference for the easier, less rewarding path.

### The Stag and Hare Theory in Action

- **Theory Overview:** The Stag and Hare theory illustrates a decision-making dilemma where cooperation yields a high reward (hunting a stag) but requires mutual effort and trust, while an individualistic approach guarantees a lower reward (hunting a hare).

- **Application in Grant Ships:** This theory translates into the Grant Ships context as a choice between impactful grants requiring collective strategies (the stag) and low-impact, easy grants (the hare). The highest impact, akin to successfully hunting the stag, is achieved when both ships collaborate on high-impact grants, trusting each other to maintain this high-impact focus.

### The Essence of Cooperative vs. Competitive Dynamics

- **Cooperative Games:** In Grant Ships, cooperative strategies are crucial. By working together, participants enhance the collective value and effectiveness of grants, fostering a culture of synergy and mutual benefit.

- **Non-Cooperative Games:** This aspect introduces a competitive edge, especially in grant allocations. The competitive nature drives participants to excel, elevating the quality and impact of grant proposals.

### The Balance of Zero-Sum and Non-Zero-Sum Elements

-   **Non-Zero-Sum Dynamics:** Grant Ships encapsulates scenarios that might resemble a mix of negative-sum for some participants and positive-sum for others. This is particularly evident in competitive grant rounds, where the outcomes for different parties can vary significantly. One participant's gain may result in another's loss, or funding allocations may increase or decrease based on performance, creating a dynamic environment where the impact of decisions is not uniformly distributed.
    
-   **Positive-Sum Environment:** At its core, Grant Ships predominantly operates as a positive-sum game. In this environment, collaborative efforts and mutual support are not just encouraged but integral to the system's success. This approach fosters a thriving ecosystem where all participants, despite their individual strategies or outcomes in specific scenarios, have opportunities for growth and significant impact. The positive-sum nature of Grant Ships ensures that the collective advancement and effectiveness of the entire ecosystem are prioritized, creating a scenario where the whole is greater than the sum of its parts.
    

These dynamics highlight the complex interplay of cooperation, competition, and strategy in Grant Ships. The system's design encourages participants to navigate between individualistic and collaborative approaches, balancing personal objectives with the broader goal of enhancing the overall impact and success of the ecosystem.

The Grant Ships model emphasizes the value of cooperative high-impact strategies and mutual trust, mirroring the principles of the Stag and Hare theory. This approach not only maximizes individual successes but also contributes to the collective advancement and effectiveness of the entire ecosystem.

### Leveraging Game Theory for Mutual Benefit in Grant Ships

At the core of Grant Ships, our strategy revolves around maximizing collective success by encouraging all participating ships to operate within the high-impact quadrant, as illustrated in our Nash Equilibrium model. This approach is rooted in the concept of measuring and amplifying impact, thereby spotlighting those actors who contribute most significantly to the community. In essence, Grant Ships creates an environment where the motivation to deliver high-impact grants is not just encouraged but becomes a strategic necessity. This ecosystem ensures that projects with substantial impact receive ample funding.

One of the key mechanisms of this model is the mutual benefit it offers. As more ships align their efforts towards high-impact initiatives, the overall efficacy and impact of the community as a whole are enhanced. It's akin to the adage, "A rising tide lifts all boats," where the collective pursuit of high-impact goals elevates the entire community. This synergy not only fosters a spirit of collaboration but also drives a competitive edge, ensuring that each ship continually strives to optimize its impact.
