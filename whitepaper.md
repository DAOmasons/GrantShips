## What is a Grant Ship?

A Grant Ship is a Sub DAO of Arbitrum DAO. Each Ship is allocated funding during a funding round, to be distributed to successful Grant applicants.

Each active Ship is able to design and implement their grant system, with a goal of providing Grants to people or projects that support the known priorities of Arbitrum DAO.

Ship operators must follow the rules of the game, such as alignment with our compliance policy and or providing a high level of ethical standards. Other than that, operators are free to run their ships as they please. They may set up their own communications channels and create their own rules that they will follow.

## Existing Grants Frameworks

This is a very brief on a few of the many Grant givers in the space. While there are many more and I am certainly not hitting all of the methos they use to allocate funding, this group gives a fair representation as to what *most* programs operate.
### Gitcoin

- Incorporates DeFi strategies.

### Octant

- Involves staking Golem tokens to allocate rewards to various projects or donation pools.
- Runs seasonal rounds every three months.
- Golem stakes substantial ETH for additional grant funding.

### Optimism PGR Rounds

- Retroactively funds impactful projects on Optimism.
- Critique: The model encourages working without guaranteed compensation.

### Gnosis

- Described as being managed with rigid control and complex application processes.
- Funding is categorized into specific initiatives, which can be limiting for cross-disciplinary projects.

### Nouns

- Relies on forum postings, lacks focused direction.

## Comparative Analysis: Similarities and Differences


Grant Ships stands out with its pluralistic nature, allowing for diverse approaches in grant allocation. Pluralism here means the coexistence of multiple states, groups, principles, or authorities, as well as the recognition of more than one ultimate principle. This philosophical foundation enables Grant Ships to experiment with various grant allocation methodologies, like retroactive funding for completed projects or support for ongoing initiatives.

This flexibility and the ability to adapt to different philosophies and tools is what makes Grant Ships unique and effective. It captures a range of approaches to grant awards, acknowledging that the best methods are often situation-dependent. The platform's goal is to foster an environment conducive to innovation and experimentation in grant allocation.

## Game Theory in Grant Ships

### Overview of Game Theory Application

Game theory, a study of strategic decision-making, plays a critical role in shaping the dynamics of Grant Ships. By leveraging game theory principles, Grant Ships aims to create a competitive yet collaborative environment, driving participants towards optimal performance and contribution. This section explores the key game theories utilized in Grant Ships and how they influence behavior and outcomes within the ecosystem.

### Nash Equilibrium in the Context of Grant Ships

#### Strategic Decision-Making:
- In Grant Ships, each Ship (or player) makes strategic decisions regarding the allocation of grants, the selection of projects, and the adoption of various approaches to maximize their impact within the Arbitrum ecosystem.
- These decisions are based not only on their own goals and objectives but also on an understanding of the strategies and actions of other Ships.

#### Mutual Interdependence:
- The strategic interdependence among Ships is a crucial aspect. Each Ship's decision potentially influences the choices of others. For example, if one Ship adopts a particularly effective grant allocation strategy, others might be inclined to adopt similar strategies, leading to a form of strategic alignment.
- However, the goal is not to have a homogenous set of strategies but rather a diverse yet stable ecosystem where each Ship's approach is respected and valued.

#### Achieving Nash Equilibrium:
- Nash Equilibrium in Grant Ships is achieved when all Ships, after considering the strategies of others, find that they cannot improve their position by unilaterally changing their strategy.
- This doesn’t mean that all Ships follow the same strategy. Instead, it indicates that each Ship has found a strategy that works best for them within the context of the overall game environment and the actions of other Ships.

#### Stability and Dynamism:
- The equilibrium brings a certain level of stability to the ecosystem. Ships are less likely to make frequent, drastic changes to their strategies, leading to a more predictable and reliable grant allocation process.
- However, this stability does not imply stagnation. Ships can still innovate and adapt within their strategic framework, contributing to the dynamism and evolution of the Grant Ships ecosystem.

#### Encouraging Collaboration and Competition:
- By striving for Nash Equilibrium, Grant Ships encourages a balance between collaboration and competition. Ships are motivated to compete by improving their strategies but also to collaborate, as the success of the ecosystem depends on the collective contributions of all participants.

### Why Achieve Nash Equilibrium?

#### For the Arbitrum Ecosystem:

1. **Stability and Predictability:** When Grant Ships reach a Nash Equilibrium, it creates a stable and predictable environment within the Arbitrum ecosystem. This stability attracts more developers and projects, as they can rely on consistent and rational funding patterns.
2. **Optimized Resource Allocation:** Nash Equilibrium leads to more efficient allocation of resources. Ships, understanding each other's strategies, are less likely to waste resources on ineffective or duplicated efforts.
3. **Enhanced Reputation:** A balanced and well-functioning grant system enhances the reputation of the Arbitrum ecosystem, positioning it as a leading platform for innovation and community-driven development.

#### For Grant Recipients:

1. **Fair and Transparent Funding:** A Nash Equilibrium scenario ensures that grant allocation is fair, transparent, and based on the merit of the projects, as Ships would have optimized their strategies to support the most impactful projects.
2. **Diverse Funding Opportunities:** With each Ship adopting a strategy that works best within the equilibrium, grant recipients benefit from a diversity of funding avenues and criteria, catering to a wider range of projects and needs.
3. **Consistent Support:** Recipients can expect consistent support and guidelines from the Ships, which helps in better planning and execution of their projects.

#### For an Individual Grant Ship:

1. **Strategic Efficiency:** Achieving Nash Equilibrium allows a Grant Ship to operate with a strategy that is most efficient and effective given the context of other Ships’ strategies. This reduces wasted efforts and increases the impact of their funding.
2. **Competitive Edge:** While the equilibrium ensures stability, it also encourages Ships to innovate within their strategic framework to maintain or enhance their effectiveness, thus fostering a healthy competitive environment.
3. **Community Alignment:** A Grant Ship operating at equilibrium is well-aligned with the community’s needs and expectations, leading to better relationships with project creators and increased trust within the ecosystem.


The achievement of Nash Equilibrium within Grant Ships is beneficial across multiple levels. For the Arbitrum ecosystem, it brings stability and efficiency; for grant recipients, it ensures fairness, diversity, and consistency; and for individual Grant Ships, it results in strategic efficiency, competitive advantage, and stronger community alignment. This equilibrium is not about uniformity but about finding the most effective role each player can have in a complex, dynamic system, leading to collective growth and innovation.


#### Cooperative vs. Non-Cooperative Games
- **Cooperative Games:** In Grant Ships, cooperative game theory is applied where participants, such as Grant Ship Operators and Grantees, collaborate to maximize the collective benefit. This collaboration is essential in creating synergies and enhancing the overall value of the ecosystem.
- **Non-Cooperative Games:** This aspect introduces an element of competition among participants, especially in the allocation of grants. The competitive nature motivates participants to put forth their best efforts, enhancing the quality and impact of proposals.
#### Zero-Sum vs. Non-Zero-Sum Games
- **Zero-Sum Games:** Although not the primary focus, certain aspects of Grant Ships may resemble zero-sum dynamics, where the gain of one participant is offset by the loss of another, especially in competitive grant allocation rounds.
- **Non-Zero-Sum Games:** Predominantly, Grant Ships operates as a non-zero-sum game, where cooperative strategies and mutual support lead to benefits for all, fostering a thriving ecosystem where every participant can find opportunities for growth and impact.

### Harnessing Game Theory for Collective Success

The application of game theory in Grant Ships is designed to foster an environment where strategic decision-making, cooperation, and healthy competition coexist. By understanding and applying these game theory concepts, participants can effectively navigate the ecosystem, making decisions that not only benefit their individual goals but also contribute positively to the broader Arbitrum community. This balanced approach ensures that Grant Ships remains a dynamic, inclusive, and impactful platform for decentralized grant allocation.
