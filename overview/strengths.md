<details>

<summary>Pluralistic Design</summary>

Pluralism is our primary design consideration. Nearly all of the coordination, creativity, and decision-making is left up to the individual Grant Ships.

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>Capture Resistance</strong></summary>

This game decomposes the traditional, centralized grants-giving committee pattern and distributes power and responsibility among Grant Ships, Referees, and the voting community - each serving as a check and balance on the others.

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>Accountability</strong></summary>

Each Grant Ship is incentivized to monitor, document, and report on progress made by grant recipients. Grant recipients are incentivized to produce results and disclose progress to receive more funding in the following season.

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>Voter Participation</strong></summary>

This game is a spectator sport, designed to be fun to play and watch. This is necessary to ensure the ecosystem stays involved and provides the right incentives and signals.

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>Adaptive Approach</strong></summary>

Through token-weighted voting, Arbitrum DAO creates the selective pressure that forces Grant Ships to evolve. As Arbitrum evolves, so will its grants program.
